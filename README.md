Hey there! I'm @HolyHotDogs, a developer with over a decade in scripting, coding, and creating innovative solutions. 
My journey in the world of programming has been about the same as everybody else's. GitHub is where I intend to showcase 
some of my projects and contributions to the open-source community.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in eating copious amounts of pasta on the reg.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about cloud based infrastructure and Kubernetes.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at holyhotdogs@proton.me OR on Discord @holyhotdogs.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His or you could just say Hotdog, Salami Swami, Sultan of Sausage, or Big Kielbasa.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't really like hotdogs. The name comes from the old 'Adam West' era Batman show.
